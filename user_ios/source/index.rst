Getting Started
==================

Welcome to the CentreStack iOS Client User Guide. This guide describes the iOS client application for CentreStack, the managed file synchronization, and sharing solution.

Users can access CentreStack cloud files using any device of their choice as CentreStack has clients for Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows 8+, and more. We have created a native IOS application that you can download from the App Store. This provides access to files and folders in your CentreStack account.

The white-labeled CentreStack iOS app called “Cloud Drive” by Gladinet that can be distributed by service providers and enterprises to their users. 

If you have the fully branded CentreStack iOS client, the look and feel of the app may be different but the functionality is the same. You can obtain a fully branded CentreStack IOS Client with your company name and product logo from http://www.centrestack.com (partner portal).

Gladinet’s vision is to enable access to enterprise data from anywhere using any device including mobile devices like Android, iPhones, and iPads. The iOS CentreStack application is feature-rich which allows enterprise users to not only access the data but also sync and collaborate on that data. Users can access, share, edit, and perform other functions on the data when accessing from iOS devices just like they do when they access it from Windows or MAC clients.
